- Bypassing Google Drive quota https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2490111#p2490111

>1. You need a gmail account, with access to the google drive service, which is essential for this by-pass method to work. If you're not willing to register a gmail account, you can stop reading here;
>2. Unlike the old "copy to your drive" method (which doesn't work anymore anyway), the free space you have on your google drive is irrelevant for this method;
>3. If you're downloading a single file, you'll need a "dummy" file for the by-pass method to work, because it relies on downloading at least TWO FILES at the same time. I'll post an example on the steps below;
>4. It is recommended you use Google Chrome browser for these procedure (it could also work on other browsers, there have been a few positive reports regarding this situation)

ADDING THE SHORTCUTS	
1. Open the google drive link and add it as shortcut. It doesn't take up any space from your own google drive, so the size of the file you want to download doesn't matter at all.
2. As I wrote above, this method only works provided you download more than 1 file at once; therefore, I recommend you have a "dummy" file permanently added as a shortcut on your google drive (preferably a small file).

DOWNLOAD
1. Now go to your gmail account, and open google drive. If you did the previous step correctly, you should have those two files in your shortcuts folder.
2. Now all that's left is to download. Remember you have to select at least two files for the method to work.
3. Actually, there's something else. If the game you want is split into multiple parts and you use the bypass method to download each at a time - and this is my personal recommendation, don't ever try to download multiple 10Gb parts at the same time or you'll be left waiting for hours until compression finishes - you WILL need to rename the downloaded file before extracting the whole thing, because Google Drive tends to add an unnecessary "-002" suffix. This situation I exposed should be rather obvious to people that deal with compressed files frequently, but I came across some who had problems with this, and were saying the downloaded parts were corrupt when they actually weren't.
